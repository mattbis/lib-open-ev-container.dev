2. its first purpose is to ensure rescue of projects no matter waht,....

  i. an export should be symbols and containers of export serialisers... it can just be this in the common formats.. it can be in various resolution containers so long as the chunk data is compatible.. ( todo ) 

a. scale, standard, precision, units.
