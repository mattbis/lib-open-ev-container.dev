#### this might be removed as it means really inefficient structures./..
1. json and xml are very bad versions but structured the reason is to ensure nothing is lost.. 
2. bison or whatever is much faster. and other formats.. however they are more groupings of data.. 
3. serialiser is either raw chunks with a lookup or just xml and json to ensure it always works
4. xml and json work everywhere this is one aim i have.. however a binary version is needed... 
5. oevcontfb is a place holder format for this.. that is a simple buffer.. 

- in reality peopel have limited time so in effect i dont really care what format its in so long as it works good enough to get a representation  that then works broadly or as an IL ... ( thats all this is )
