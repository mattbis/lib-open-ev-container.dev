currently confusing since this is both how the standard works and how its released; and well everything so it needs a really better structure.. might have to break some rules.. since there isnt one `src` really... many

also `res` is kinda like a repo lib that has stuff that shuold work around releases but is tied to them... 
( although in theory this shoudl never stop working once it is X1 since the entire idea is it its just this.. 

and the subversions will be the chore() and ting of change...
