## no music must be lost all data must be preseved.
### the container
- it has to be support a schema generated or based on the internal standard, the describes said events ... and the the multitude of these..
- the data is in binary with a lookup IL to generalise it.. or its entirely free/open format.
- it might contain if primary format protected data hashed in some way... 
- its purpose is to generalise data and allow tiers that modify a tree to archive, serialise, <describe changes> for a project.
- any point of this container data, can be historically referenced.
- the container allows the conversion of inner data formats ( if they are complete assets, or presets etc ) into other formats....
### why should i bother
- by default its fast, you can do this as another export option
- all music must be saved and interchangeable...
