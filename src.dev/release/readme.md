### releases 

- the container itself will never change without a major ... any release cadence would be on container code and includes...
- the standard format of buffers in the typical structure is versioned... and the base will not be released until all initiating parties agree on it.

#### this dir specifies how the src is modified or included... since its strictly controlled by a linear mod registry
