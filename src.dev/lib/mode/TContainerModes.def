## modes can be combined or alias others

fast # monikier for incremental + checksum
slow # the container is an exact new representation and replaces itself
incremental # the container is buffering updates
parity # the container is self repairing
checksum # all paths are checksumed
exportable # exportable containers have more config blocks
custom-il # has extensions to the symbol language ( this lookup is embedded into the container since its entire purpose is to ensure a project can never be lost )
